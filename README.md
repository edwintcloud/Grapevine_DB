# RAG DB

A graph theory project for a graph database.

## Abstract

Finding indirect relationships is not an easy or typical usage for traditional databases. A graph database is designed in such a way that makes finding indirect associations for applications such as a social network or reccomendation engine much more efficient and easy. Below is a great photo from Nicolle Cysneiros Blog Post about Graph Databases on Medium to display the typical structure which I will be modeling:

Here are the problems I wish to solve with this project:

1. Quickly find specific types of associations in a set of data.
2. Find the level of association for indirect associations in order to make determinations or reccomendations.
3. Categorize differing data by common associations.
